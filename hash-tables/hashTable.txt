- A great resource to have when trying to decrease the space-time complexity of a problem.
- Key lookup values that simplify how you view the data.
- Very similar to an array
    - Array you find your value based on an offset in memory (index) "array[index]"
    - In a hash table you will find your value based on a key.
    - Lookup of the key to value is typically constant O(1) but can grow to O(n) if the implementation is bad.

- Secret sauce - the lookup function.
