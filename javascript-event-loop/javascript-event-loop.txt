What are some of the components of NodeJS
- V8 for our Javascript engine
- LibUV for asyncronous actions like the event-loop and threads.

What are threads and the thread pool?
NodeJS Process 
    - Instant of the NodeJS application
    - Single Threaded
    - Do not block the thread!
    - Top level code executed -> Modules required --> Register callbacks

Thread Pool 
    - Additional 4 threads that are completely seperate from the main thread.
    - Event loop will offload expensive tasks to the thread pool. (asyncronous events)

What is the event loop?
    - A place where all the application code that is inside a callback function is ran. (Non-top-level code)
    - Asyncronous code emits an event when it's done executing and the event loop will come to pick up that code and execute the callback function.

Event Loop Phases
    - Expired Timer callbacks - Executes the callback functions when there events are emitted.
    - I//O Polling and callbacks - File access and networking APIs
    - setImmediate callbacks - Special timer fires immediately after I/O Polling
    - Close callbacks - 
    - Other microtasks queue & process.nextick - execute after each phase of the event loop.
        - Includes resolved promises.
