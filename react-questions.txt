What is JSX?
- JSX stands for Javascript XML, it is a markup language that allows you to write Javascript alongside your HTML.
- It's also syntactic sugar, under the hood react is calling React.createElement() to create the javascript.

Why is classname used instead of class.
- Class is a reserved word in javascript, when your code is being transformed by Babel the Javascript engine would think
- you were trying to create a class and not give an element a class name.

Describe the data flow in React.
- The data flow in React is unidirection, it flows from parent to child.

How would you delay an API call until a component is mounted?
- Class based - componentDidMount() 
- Functional Components with hooks - useEffect(() => []) - Dependancy arrays

Should you use && or ternary operator?
- Ternary operator - if && is present only the left side of a falsy operation will be evaluted. Could return 
- and possibly render 0 or undefined
